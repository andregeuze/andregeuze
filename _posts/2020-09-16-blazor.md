Recently I have been getting a lot of experience in the amazing world of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). If you haven't heard of it yet, go check it out!

In a nutshell, here's what it's about:

> Imagine a world, where your favourite language (C#) can both be used for Frontend and Backend development, without a real need for JavaScript. Blazor is here for you

Or maybe a bit less floaty:

> Hate JavaScript? Cool, do Blazor then

Anyway, let's get on with it!

<div class="jumbotron">
    <h1 class="display-3">Hello, world!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component
        for calling extra attention to featured content or
        information.
    </p>
</div>
