Recently I have been getting a lot of experience in the amazing world of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). If you haven't heard of it yet, go check it out!

In a nutshell, here's what it's about:

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    <p class="mb-0">Imagine a world, where your favourite language (C#) can both be used for Frontend and Backend development, without a real need for JavaScript. Blazor is here for you.</p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer">Someone in <cite title="the World">the World</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

Or maybe a bit less floaty:

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    <p class="mb-0">Hate JavaScript development and the 1000 frameworks to choose from? Cool, do Blazor then.</p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer">Me on <cite title="https://andregeuze.github.io">this Blog</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

Anyway, let's get on with it!
